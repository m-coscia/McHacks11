# Wheat Together
Submission for McHacks 2024

Wheat Together is a Google chrome extension that translates up-to-date weather information from English to French, while also providing essential real-time localized weather details for major agricultural communities in Canada. This dual approach ensures that farmers and others in the agricultural sector have access to both general forecasts and specific regional data in their preferred language, to hopefully aid in informed decision-making.
